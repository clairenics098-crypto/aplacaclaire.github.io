            Technology becomes more meaningful when it is guided by faith.
            Instead of using digital platforms for negativity, we can use them
            to inspire hope, kindness, and unity.

        <p>
            Through websites, social media, and digital projects, we can share
            inspirational messages, Bible verses, and positive content that uplift
            others. This shows how faith and technology can work together.
